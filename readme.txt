The objective of the file 'clean_data.ipynb' involves reading a dataset file, implementing necessary modifications, and ultimately storing it as ‘cleaned_data_for_prediction.csv' for subsequent processing in the file ‘model_prediction.ipynb'.

The primary aim of the file "model_prediction.ipynb" is to process a refined dataset, conducting model predictions, and perform clustering using the ‘t-SNE' methodology.

The intention behind the utilization of the file ‘clean_data_xlstat.ipynb' is to read a dataset file and make necessary adjustments. The output derived from the execution of this file appears as ‘clean_data_xlstat.csv'.

Subsequently, this particular file is intended for use with the file ‘corelation.ipynb'. The responsibilities of the latter include selecting features and creating the file ‘without_ordinal_encoding_0.2_edition.csv' tailored for use in the ‘XLSTAT' software within Excel.

The file ‘stat_diagram.ipynb' is exclusively dedicated to generating statistical visual representations.
